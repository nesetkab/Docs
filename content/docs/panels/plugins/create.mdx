title: Creating a Plugin
---

You can view an example project structure for multiple plugins here:  
🔗 [Panels Example Plugins Folder](https://github.com/lazarcloud/ftcontrol/tree/main/plugins/example)

This example includes a preconfigured Gradle setup designed to help you build and manage multiple plugins efficiently.  

### Gradle Setup

Inside the example repository, the `build.gradle` files are annotated with `TODO` comments that guide you through the setup process for creating new plugins:
- Define plugin names and structure
- Handle dependencies and shared logic
- Build everything into JARs ready for deployment

> Just follow the comments inside the `gradle` files to scaffold your own plugin projects quickly.
