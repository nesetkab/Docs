Migrating to Pedro 2.0.0 has a few steps.

## Convert your constants

1. Open the [constants migrator](https://pedro-pathing.github.io/ConstantsConverter/)
in your browser of choice.
2. Input your existing `FConstants` and `LConstants` classes into
the converter.
3. Click "convert".
4. Create a `Constants.java` file and paste the output of the
converter into that class.

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
  The constants converter does **not** add the package declaration or
  imports. You must keep the package declaration and use Android Studio's
  auto import to add the imports.
</Callout>

## Add the tuning OpModes
Copy the [`Tuning.java` file](https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart/blob/dev/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/pedroPathing/Tuning.java)
and place it in your project.

This OpMode contains all the tuners and tests needed to tune Pedro and verify
that it is correctly working.

To use the OpMode:

1. Initialize the OpMode.
2. Use a gamepad to navigate through the folders as instructed in telemetry.
3. Select a tuner/test by pressing the right bumper.
4. Instructions will be displayed via telemetry.
5. Press play to start the tuner/test!

## Change how you create Follower
Instead of directly using the `Follower` constructor, we now use the
`createFollower` in our `Constants` class.

To create a `Follower`, do:

```java
follower = Constants.createFollower(hardwareMap);
```
