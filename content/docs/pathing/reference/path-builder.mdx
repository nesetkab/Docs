description: Using the PathBuilder

Want to make your robot follow a smooth, custom path? The `PathBuilder` in Pedro Pathing is your go-to tool for chaining together curves and controlling how your robot turns along the way. It’s designed to be flexible, readable, and—most importantly—easy to use.

## What is PathBuilder?

Think of `PathBuilder` as a way to “draw” your robot’s route using Bézier curves, then tell it exactly how to turn as it moves. You can add as many path segments as you want, and tweak how the robot finishes each one. It’s all about making complex autos feel simple.

## How do I use it?

Here’s a classic example. Let’s say you want your robot to go from a scoring position to a pickup, then back again, turning smoothly as it moves:

```java
path = follower.pathBuilder()
    .addPath(new BezierLine(new Point(scorePose), new Point(pickup1Pose)))
    .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(scorePose.getHeading(), pickup1Pose.getHeading())
    .addPath(new BezierLine(new Point(pickup1Pose), new Point(scorePose)))
    .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(pickup1Pose.getHeading(), scorePose.getHeading())
    .build();

follower.followPath(path);
```

## What can I do with it?

- **addPath(path):** Add a Bézier curve or other curve to your chain.
- **setHeadingInterpolation(HeadingInterpolator):** Control the robot's heading while following paths. (See [Interpolation](/docs/pathing/reference/interpolation)) 
- **setBrakingStrength(double):** Control your deceleration (See [Deceleration](/docs/pathing/reference/deceleration))
- **setTValueConstraint(double):** Control when each path is considered complete (See [Path Constraints](/docs/pathing/reference/constraints) for more on timing.)
- **build():** Finish up and get your path ready to follow.

## Pro Tips

- All headings are in **radians**—don’t forget to use `Math.toRadians(degrees)` if you’re starting with degrees!
- You can chain as many `addPath` and heading methods as you want. Build something wild.
