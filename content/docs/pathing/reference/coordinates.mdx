Pedro Pathing uses a right-hand coordinate system, which is nonstandard to the FTC SDK Standard.

As shown, as a robot moves to the left in the image below, x increases. As a robot moves up on the field image, y increases.  

A robot facing the right side of the image is at a heading of 0 radians (0 degrees), facing up is pi/2 radians (90 degrees), facing left is pi radians (180 degrees), and facing down is (3*pi)/2 radians (270 degrees).
Thus, counterclockwise rotation is positive rotation, similar to a unit circle.
