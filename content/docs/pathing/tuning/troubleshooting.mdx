If you have trouble during your tuning, this page may cover some common
issues that are had, just click to expand the dropdown. Otherwise, join the
[Pedro Pathing Discord](https://discord.gg/2GfC4qBP5s) and ask in `#general`
or in the `#tuning-help` channels. When asking in `#tuning-help`, please
provide additional information other than your issue. This could be a video,
your constants, telemetry outputs, logcat, or any other information.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Bad Localization">
    **If you're using a two wheel localizer:**

    Check whether:
    - Your encoder's `HardwareMapName` is incorrect or if the parallel &
    perpendicular odometry pods' names are swapped.
    - Your encoders directions are reversed.
    - Your IMU orientations (`LogoFacingDirection`, `UsbFacingDirection`) are
    incorrect.
    - Your odometry pod offsets are inaccurate

    Try also running `Forward Tuner` and `Lateral Tuner` more times to get more
    accurate results for `forwardTicksToInches` and `strafeTicksToInches`.

    **If you're using a three wheel localizer:**

    Check whether:
    - Your encoder's `HardwareMapName` is incorrect or if a parallel &
    perpendicular odometry pods' names are swapped (will result in robot
    rotating and translating if swapped).
    - Your encoders directions are reversed.
    - Your IMU orientations (`LogoFacingDirection`, `UsbFacingDirection`) are
    incorrect (only for Three Wheel IMU).
    - Your odometry pod offsets are inaccurate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Robot Turns 180 and Oscillates During Heading Tuner">
    This behavior is due to incorrect motor hardwareMap associations.
    Usually, this means that the front motors need to be swapped with the rear
    motors.
    Or that your odometry offsets offsets have the wrong sign.
    Try testing that the motors are correctly associated with their hardwareMap
    names by running the Tuning OpMode and navigating `Localization > Motor
    Directions` to test.
    It may require you to swap hardwareMap names or the ports in which motors
    are plugged into.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Robot Drifts Tuning Drive Tuner">
    **If you're using a drive encoders, two wheel, three wheel, or OTOS,** a
    small amount of drift will happen over time, as these localizers aren't
    perfect.
    However, the tolerance should remain manageable for the entire 30 second
    autonomous period.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Robot Movements are Too Jittery">
    Check your `brakingStrength` in `PathConstraints` and try decreasing it
    slightly. This will make the braking smoother and reduce the
    oscillations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Robot Never Stops or Moves in the Wrong Direction">
    **Check if:**
    - Your localization is inaccurate. Run `LocalizationTest` and check:
    - when you move the robot forward, does the x-value increase?
    - when you move the robot to the left, does the y-value increase?
    - is the reported heading accurate?
    If not, head over back to the localization section and double check your
    steps. Ensure that your localization is fully accurate before tuning your
    PIDFs and running automatic tuners.
    - Your motor directions are reversed.
    - Your motor configurations are incorrect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Robot Never Moves During TranslationalTuner or HeadingTuner">
    **If you are tuning for Translational or Heading PIDF, it is intentional
    that the robot doesn't initially move.**
    However, if you push/turn the robot and it still doesn't move, check whether
    your P value in the PIDF is too low. Increasing it may give more power for
    your robot to correct back to its original position.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot See the Constants in Panels">
    If the Tuning class dropdown in the Panels Configurables is empty, double
    check that you have selected an OpMode in the Tuning OpMode using the
    gamepad before reloading the Panels website. The Panels website is accessible at the ip address
    `192.168.43.1:8001` when connected to robot wifi.
